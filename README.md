# CAR PRICE PREDICTION

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

In the competitive automotive market, understanding and predicting car prices is crucial for manufacturers, dealers, and consumers. Car Price Prediction leverages data analytics and machine learning to estimate the market value of vehicles based on various attributes. By analyzing historical data, the model provides valuable insights that aid in pricing strategies, market analysis, and decision-making. From identifying key price determinants to refining valuation techniques, Car Price Prediction empowers stakeholders to make data-driven choices and stay ahead in the market.

# DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset contains information about various car attributes and their prices. Here is a description of each column:

- **Car_ID**: Unique identifier for each car (integer).
- **Car_Name**: Name of the car (object).
- **Year**: Year the car was manufactured (integer).
- **Selling_Price**: Price at which the car is being sold (float).
- **Present_Price**: Current ex-showroom price of the car (float).
- **Kms_Driven**: Distance driven in kilometers (integer).
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel used by the car (object).
- **Seller_Type**: Type of seller (object).
- **Transmission**: Transmission type of the car (object).
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners (integer).

# ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE

The analysis aims to:

1. Understand the key factors affecting car prices.
2. Clean and preprocess the data for robust analysis.
3. Build a predictive model to estimate car prices based on various attributes.
4. Provide actionable insights for pricing strategies and market analysis.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
3. **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

# FILES INCLUDED

1. **Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code and model.
2. **car_data.csv**: CSV file containing the car dataset used for analysis.
3. **README.md**: Project overview, dataset description, analysis objectives, tools and technologies, files included and conclusion.

# CONCLUSION

The Linear Regression model emerged as moderatively accurate for predicting car prices, highlighting present price, year of manufacture, and kilometers driven as significant factors. Diesel cars generally have higher prices than petrol cars, and pricing varies between cars sold by individual owners and dealers. These insights guide pricing strategies and market analysis. To optimize pricing and enhance market analysis, it is recommended to leverage the model for competitive pricing, tailor strategies to market segments, and use data to understand customer preferences and trends. Regularly updating the model with new data is essential for maintaining accuracy. Focusing on feature engineering, regional analysis, model improvement, and monitoring market trends will help stakeholders drive sales growth and enhance overall business success in the automotive market.
